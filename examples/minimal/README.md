# Minimal Example

Bare minimum example of using `react-use-googlelogin` in a React app. Utilizes
TypeScript, but the minimal code is completely interopable with JavaScript.

## Running

To run this example:

```bash
# Install deps with yarn
yarn

# Or use npm
npm i

# Start the development server

Be sure to replace the placeholder `clientId` with your own.
